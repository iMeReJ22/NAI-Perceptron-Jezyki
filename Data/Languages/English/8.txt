Airplanes are one of the greatest achievements of mankind in the field of air transportation. They are widely used to travel long distances, both by individuals and by commercial airlines. Airplanes allow for fast and safe travel to other continents, making the world more accessible.

Many people are fascinated by the fact that airplanes can stay aloft and maintain altitude for long periods of time. This is due to the principles of aerodynamics on which airplane design is based. Thanks to wings that generate lift, airplanes can stay in the air, and thanks to engines, they can move at high speeds. On the other hand, the weight of the airplane is balanced by the thrust generated by the engines.

Unfortunately, airplanes also generate a lot of harmful emissions that contribute to air pollution. In recent years, there has been increasing focus on improving the energy efficiency of airplanes and using more environmentally friendly fuels. Nevertheless, the development of airplanes still presents a major challenge for science and technology, and every step towards more environmentally friendly aviation technology is crucial for the future of our planet.
